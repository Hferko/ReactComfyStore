The Comfy Store is a React app for a furniture store.

The app allows users to order, shop, and request delivery online.

The app receives data through API queries using AXIOS and React Query frameworks.

Data processing is done using the Redux Toolkit, and the menu system is done using React Rooter.

Planning and design are John Smilga's (https://www.codingaddict.io/) work using Tailwind and daisyUI(https://daisyui.com/).
